/* ══ Eye tracker ═══════════════════════════════════════════
   A ball with two eyes that watches your cursor, wherever it is
   on the page.

   ── THE EYES ARE ON THE BALL, NOT IN FRONT OF IT ───────────
   The easy version slides two shapes toward the pointer, and it
   reads as stickers on a disc. Here each eye is a point on the
   sphere's surface: looking left turns the ball, so an eye
   travels along the curve, and the one heading for the rim
   moves less and narrows as it turns away from you while the
   other swings wide. That foreshortening is the whole trick —
   it is what makes a flat circle read as something round.

   One turn (yaw and pitch) is the state, sprung toward where
   the pointer is; both eyes are read off it, so they can never
   disagree. It relaxes back to facing you when the pointer
   leaves the window, and it blinks on its own now and then.

   Written straight to the DOM every frame, never through state:
   a pointer move is not a render. */

/* ── inlined from lab/spring ──────────────────────── */
/* ── one spring, for everything that settles ───────────────
   The maths was already on this bench twice, copied by hand:
   Humidity's wheel and Brightness's column both accumulate
   velocity toward a target, damp it, and snap when both the
   delta and the velocity fall under 0.02. Two copies is a
   coincidence; five would be a policy, so it comes out here
   before the elastic blocks are written against it.

   The two shipped copies are deliberately NOT refactored onto
   this. They work, they are tuned, and rewriting the innards
   of two live components to prove a point about duplication
   is how a good afternoon becomes a bad one. This is the one
   new code uses.

   Frames, not milliseconds. `dt` is expressed in sixtieths of
   a second and the damping is RAISED to it rather than
   multiplied by it, so a dropped frame decays the same amount
   of energy as the two frames it replaced. Multiplying is the
   version that makes a spring behave differently on a busy
   page, which is the hardest kind of bug to see.

   The loop parks itself the moment the value has settled.
   CLAUDE.md is not complimentary about the one permanent
   requestAnimationFrame already on this bench and there is no
   case for five more. */

   blink the same way. Any difference in SIZE between the two is
